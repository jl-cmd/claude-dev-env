# Code Rules Reference

Compact reference for agents. ⚡ marks rules enforced by `code_rules_enforcer.py` — the hook blocks the Write/Edit and returns the corrective detail at violation time, so this document lists those rules by name only.

---

## COMMENT PRESERVATION (ABSOLUTE RULE)

**NEVER remove existing comments.** Existing comments are SACRED. Only evaluate comments on lines you are actively changing. Do not add new inline comments in production code — write self-documenting code. Docstrings (module/class/function) are always allowed. Test files are exempt. The hook enforces both directions: it blocks new inline comments AND blocks deletion of existing ones.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- **Self-documenting code** — naming over comments. Full 8-dimension rubric: `~/.claude/skills/readability-review/SKILL.md` (`/check` for parallel team review, `/readability-review` standalone).
- **Centralized configuration** — every constant lives in ONE place (`config/`).
- **Reuse before create** — search first, import second, create last.
- **Encapsulation enables cleaner naming** — `isMaxLevel(level)` > `level >= MAXIMUM_LEVEL`.

---

## ⚡ HOOK-ENFORCED RULES

`code_rules_enforcer.py` blocks each of these at Write/Edit and explains the specific violation when it fires; exact patterns and exemption lists live in the hook:

no new comments · imports at top · logging format args (`log_*("...", arg)`) · no magic values in production bodies (0, 1, -1 exempt) · UPPER_SNAKE constants only in `config/` (exempt: `config/*`, `/migrations/`, workflow registries `/workflow/` + `_tab.py` + `/states.py` + `/modules.py`, test files) · no hardcoded user home paths · guarded `sys.path.insert` · no unused module-level imports · banned identifiers (`ctx`, `cfg`, `msg`, `btn`, `idx`, `cnt`, `tmp`, `elem`, `val`) · banned function prefixes (`handle_`, `process_`, `manage_`, `do_`) · no type escape hatches (`Any` import, `cast()`, inline `Any`) outside boundary files · no bare/broad `except` · no `Any` in signatures or class attributes · no stub bodies (`pass`/`...`/`raise NotImplementedError`) outside abstract/Protocol · TypedDict `_encode_*`/`_decode_*` companions in the same module · no test-mode branching in production (use dependency injection) · no thin wrapper modules · Google-style docstrings on public functions with `Args:` matching the signature · boolean names prefixed `is_`/`has_`/`should_`/`can_`/`was_`/`did_` (assignments AND bool-typed parameters) · must-check returns (`find_and_click`, `write_outcome`) assigned and checked

Test files are exempt from most checks. See also the file-global constants use-count rule: [`rules/file-global-constants.md`](../rules/file-global-constants.md).

---

## 3. REUSE CONSTANTS / 4. CONFIG LOCATIONS

Before writing ANY constant: search `config/` for the exact value → semantic match → add to the existing config file → create new (rare). Locations: timeouts/delays/retries → `config/timing.py`; ports/URLs/thresholds → `config/constants.py`; CSS selectors → `config/selectors.py`.

---

## 5. NO ABBREVIATIONS

Full words only (`context`, not `ctx`). Exceptions: `i`/`j`/`k` in loops, `e` for exception. Naming patterns: loop vars `each_*`; booleans `is_/has_/should_/can_/was_/did_`; collections `all_*`; maps `X_by_Y`; preposition params (`from_path=`, `to=`, `into=`). Banned names: `result`, `data`, `output`, `response`, `value`, `item`, `temp`. Banned prefixes: `handle`, `process`, `manage`, `do`.

---

## 6. COMPLETE TYPE HINTS

ALL parameters typed, ALL returns typed. No `Any`, no `# type: ignore` (also enforced by the mypy_validator.py hook).

## 6.5 FILE LENGTH GUIDANCE

Advisory only, never blocking: soft advisory at >= 400 lines, strong nudge at >= 1000 (pylint / SonarQube defaults). Split on cohesion (SRP, "Large Class" smell), not line count — run the readability rubric when an advisory fires.

---

## 7. RIGHT-SIZED ENGINEERING

**Simple > Clever. Functions > Classes. Concrete > Abstract.**
Never: ABC for single impl, DI frameworks, factory for single type. Always: functions when no state, concrete classes, simple imports.

## 7.5 SOLID PRINCIPLES

**SRP always applies** — one reason to change per function/class/module. **OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP apply only where two or more concrete implementations already share a contract**; with a single concretion §7 wins (concrete classes, direct imports, YAGNI — introduce the abstraction at the commit that adds the second concretion). Misapplication signals: interface/ABC with exactly one implementation, SRP-splitting a cohesive class by size alone, abstract factories for one product, DI containers where every injected type has one concretion.

---

## 8. TDD PROCESS

1. **RED** — failing test first. 2. **GREEN** — minimum code to pass. 3. **REFACTOR** — only if valuable.

## 9. SELF-CONTAINED COMPONENTS

Components own their complete feature (state, modals, overlays, toasts). Parents just render `<Child />`.

## 9.5 NO THIN WRAPPER MODULES

A non-`__init__.py` module whose body is only imports (optionally `__all__`) is indirection without payload — callers import the real module. `__init__.py` is the canonical re-export surface and is exempt.

## 9.6 NO BACKWARDS-COMPATIBILITY SHIMS

Removed code is removed: no renamed re-export aliases, no `_old_*` aliases, no keep-alive wrapper modules, no tombstone comment markers. When a symbol's name or signature changes, update the call sites in the same commit. Git history records change; the codebase records what exists.

## 9.7 NO FALLBACK / BEST-EFFORT WRAPPERS

Never swallow a failure into a default unless the caller explicitly opted in at the boundary. Name the specific exception (`except KeyError:`) and propagate the rest — collapsing every error class to `None` masks programming errors and makes debugging impossible.

## 9.8 REMOVE CODE YOU ORPHAN (Dead Code Elimination)

An edit that deletes or rewrites code also removes everything it makes dead: unread variables, uncalled functions, unpassed parameters, dead branches, unused imports, helper files whose only consumer that edit deleted. Prove unreachability first: Serena `find_referencing_symbols` plus a text search for dynamic lookups (`getattr`, entry-point names). A symbol is live only when a reference chain reaches a live entry point (CLI command, route, public API, test); a self-referential dead cluster is removed together in the same commit. **When liveness is uncertain (public API, plugin hook, reflective dispatch), do NOT delete — surface the ambiguity via AskUserQuestion.** Source links: [`references/dead-code-elimination.md`](references/dead-code-elimination.md).

## 10. NO REDUNDANT DATA FETCHES

If you already have the data, don't fetch it again.

---

## 11. ENFORCEMENT SURFACES

⚡ **Hooks** block pattern-matchable violations at Write/Edit time. 🤖 **Prompt context** carries judgment principles (SRP, Right-Sized Engineering, conservative-action, BDD discovery; the `/code` skill prepends strict mode for a session: no `Any`/`cast()`, immutable TypedDicts with `_encode_*`/`_decode_*` + `require_*` validation, per-module `_test_hooks.py` DI, 100% statement + branch coverage, zero mocks). 👥 **Audit rubrics** (`/check`, `packages/claude-dev-env/audit-rubrics/` categories A–P) cover cross-file architectural concerns. Rules with documented-but-pending hook coverage live in `~/.claude/rules/*.md` and `skills/code/SKILL.md`; each names its own promotion path.
